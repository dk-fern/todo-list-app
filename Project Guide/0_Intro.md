## Why was this created?
This was created to show that I have a full understanding and can use API keys and endpoints within docker containers. My hope is that through also building a guide, you can practice the same skills to boost your knowledge.

## What will you learn?
- Using [CRUD operations](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-crud)
- Understanding and applying [API endpoints and authentication using keys](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/api-key)
